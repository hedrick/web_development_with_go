## Course from ["Web Development With Go"](https://www.usegolang.com/) by [Jon Calhoun](https://twitter.com/joncalhoun)

I started this course on Jan 7, 2018 to get an immersive experience in writing and using [Go](https://golang.org/) and reinforcing full-stack web development practices.

The course covers many topics from basic Go syntax to working with many [stdlib](https://golang.go/pkg/#stdlib) packages including: 

* net (net/http) 
* crypto 
* bytes
* context
* database (database/sql) 
* flag
* fmt 
* hash,
* path (path/filepath)
* strcov
* strings
* time
